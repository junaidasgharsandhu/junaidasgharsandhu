# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asgharjunaid/">Junaid Asghar</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio

I'm passionate about cybersecurity and enjoy tackling complex challenges through hands-on projects. From threat hunting and incident response to vulnerability management, these projects allow me to dive deep into the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape and contribute to improving security operations and processes.

## 🚨 Threat Hunting and Security Operations

* **[Azuki Import/Export – Incident Response & Threat Hunt (Part 1)](https://github.com/junaidasgharsandhu/azuki-threat-hunt-part1)**  
  *SOC-style incident response and threat hunting investigation using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE).  
  Focuses on initial access via compromised credentials (RDP), Defender evasion, LOLBins abuse (certutil, PowerShell, schtasks), credential dumping (LSASS), persistence mechanisms, data staging, exfiltration, and lateral movement mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.*  
  **Skills:** Threat Hunting (KQL), Incident Response, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Log Analysis, MITRE ATT&CK, Windows Internals

* **[Azuki Import/Export – Incident Response & Threat Hunt (Part 2)](https://github.com/junaidasgharsandhu/azuki-threat-hunt-mde)**  
  *Continuation of the Azuki Import/Export incident, focusing on attacker re-entry, lateral movement to a file server, internal discovery, credential access, data staging, compression, cloud-based exfiltration, and anti-forensic activity.  
  This investigation follows a full SOC-style methodology using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Sentinel, building a complete attack timeline and mapping each stage to MITRE ATT&CK.*  
  **Skills:** Threat Hunting (KQL), Incident Response, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Sentinel, Lateral Movement Analysis, Credential Access Detection, Data Exfiltration, MITRE ATT&CK

* **[Azuki Import/Export – Incident Response & Threat Hunt (Part 3)](https://github.com/junaidasgharsandhu/azuki-incident-response-report)**  
  *Advanced continuation of the Azuki incident series, expanding on post-exploitation analysis, deeper credential abuse scenarios, extended persistence techniques, and refined threat hunting methodology within Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.*  
  **Skills:** Advanced Threat Hunting, Incident Response, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Adversary Emulation, Detection Engineering

* **[Unauthorized TOR Usage – Threat Hunt](https://github.com/junaidasgharsandhu/unauthorized-tor-usage-threat-hunt)**  
  *SOC-style threat hunt detecting unauthorized TOR browser installation and anonymized network usage using MDE.
  Includes silent installer execution analysis, TOR network behavior detection, user intent artifacts, timeline  reconstruction, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.*  
  **Skills:** Threat Hunting (KQL), Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Network Analysis, MITRE ATT&CK, Incident Response

## ⚠️ Vulnerability Management Projects

* **[Vulnerability Management Program – ClearPoint Digital](https://github.com/junaidasgharsandhu/vulnerability-management-program)**  
  *End-to-end simulation of an enterprise vulnerability management program, covering policy creation, stakeholder buy-in, authenticated vulnerability scanning, remediation planning, CAB approval, and ongoing maintenance.  
  Includes Tenable-based scanning, Azure-hosted lab infrastructure, PowerShell remediation scripts, structured stakeholder and CAB meetings, risk-based prioritization, and measurable remediation outcomes.*  
  **Skills:** Vulnerability Management, Tenable/Nessus, Policy Development, Risk Prioritization, PowerShell Remediation, Change Management (CAB), Azure, Security Operations
