I'm passionate about cybersecurity and enjoy tackling complex challenges through hands-on projects. From threat hunting and incident response to vulnerability management, these projects allow me to dive deep into the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape and contribute to improving security operations and processes.

* **[Azuki Import/Export – Incident Response & Threat Hunt (Part 1)](https://github.com/junaidasgharsandhu/azuki-threat-hunt-part1)**
  *SOC-style incident response and threat hunting investigation using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE).
  Focuses on initial access via compromised credentials (RDP), Defender evasion, LOLBins abuse (certutil, PowerShell, schtasks), credential dumping (LSASS), persistence mechanisms, data staging, exfiltration, and lateral movement mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.*
  **Skills:** Threat Hunting (KQL), Incident Response, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Log Analysis, MITRE ATT&CK, Windows Internals

* **[Azuki Import/Export – Incident Response & Threat Hunt (Part 3)](https://github.com/junaidasgharsandhu/azuki-incident-response-report)**
  *Advanced continuation of the Azuki incident series, expanding on post-exploitation analysis, deeper credential abuse scenarios, extended persistence techniques, and refined threat hunting methodology within Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.*
  **Skills:** Advanced Threat Hunting, Incident Response, MDE, Adversary Emulation, Detection Engineering
